Welcome to my C Programs Repository! This collection includes various C programs that I have practiced. Whether you're a beginner learning C or an experienced developer looking for examples, feel free to explore the files.

## Instructions:

1. **Go through all the files**: Explore the programs to gain insights into different aspects of C programming.

2. **Add Comments for Understanding**: If you find any part of the code unclear, consider adding comments to explain the logic or functionality. This will help you and others understand the code more easily.

3. **Practice and Build Projects**: Take these programs as building blocks for your projects. Combine and modify them to create more complex applications. The best way to learn is by doing!

## Setup

For information on setting up your C development environment, refer to the [Setup Guide](Setup.md). This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get started with C programming.

Hopefully, this repository proves helpful and enhances your C programming skills! ðŸ˜Ž
